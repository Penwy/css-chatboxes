# css-chatboxes

This is a collection of custom CSS for twitch chatboxes. 
All of them are entirely free to use.

## Usage
Those are made to work with OBS, and kapchat's widget.    
They'll probably work with other chat widgets, provided the css selectors are edited to fit.    
They might work in other streaming software but I can't guarantee it.

1. Download the css file and the provided font for the chatbox you want.
2. Install the font (unless I messed something, all fonts should be free for commercial use).
3. Get a widget for your chat at https://nightdev.com/kapchat/ (select "None" for the theme) and add it as a browser source in OBS.
4. Copy the css from the file and paste it in the "custom css" field of the source's settings.

You do not need to download the assets, unless you want to re-host them yourself.

N.B.: I know my css is a fucking mess, it works, idgaf.
